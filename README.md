Analysis of employee compensation fairness using Equality Score
# Employee Equality Analysis

ðŸ“Š This project analyzes employee compensation fairness using an **Equality Score**.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 3 main columns:
- **Factory**
- **Job Role**
- **Equality Score** (ranging from -100 to +100, where 0 is ideal)

I added a **4th column: Equality Class** based on rules:

- **Fair** â†’ Score between -10 and +10  
- **Unfair** â†’ Score less than -10 or greater than +10  
- **Highly Discriminative** â†’ Score less than -20 or greater than +20  

## Example Classification
- Score = `10` â†’ Fair  
- Score = `-9` â†’ Fair  
- Score = `-15` â†’ Unfair  
- Score = `30` â†’ Highly Discriminative  

## Tools Used
- **Excel** (for data processing)  
- **Tableau** (for visualization)  
- *(Optional)* Python for automation  

## Results
The final dataset highlights where pay is fair and where discrimination exists, enabling HR teams to take corrective action.
